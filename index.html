            <h3>What is it?</h3>

            <p>Valhalla is a Dedicated server for Valheim written in C++.</p>

        <section>
            <h3>Background</h3>

            <p>Several smaller precursor projects eventually led to what Valhalla is today.</p>

            <p>I can't remember exactly when, but development started around ~2020-2021 when I was getting into networking for the first time.

                One of my first projects was 
                
                <a href="https://github.com/PeriodicSeizures/CPPNetworking">CPPNetworking</a>, a C++ networking experiment with very basic client/server interactions.

                It is since left abandoned, a relic of the past. It goes to show how little I was familiar with back then.

            <h3>Roadmap</h3>

            <p>There are some annoying bugs in the project, likely as a result of my

                inability to run normal unit tests (I'm disorganized).
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>Why?</h3>

            <p>I fell in love with Valheim. I also like C++. 
                
                The current Valheim Dedicated server also sucks. 

                Why not create a Valheim server in C++?
