                Valheim utilizes session-independent hashes that
                are computed from strings. These hashes are signed 
                32-bit integers, and are used for:
                
                <ul>
                    <li>Prefabs - The identity of an object</li>
                    <li>Animations - Particular animations a Character can play</li>
                    <li>
                        ZDO members - ZDO's (likely stands for "zone data object") are responsible for keeping 
                        objects between clients and servers synchronized and up-to-date. ZDO members refers
                        to individual dictionary mapped key-value pairs a ZDO can hold, which vary per ZDO.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        ZRpc/ZRoutedRpc/ZNetView identifiers - Rpc refers to remote function calling on the 
                        network side of Valheim. It is what handles most actions a client requests to take, 
                        bound to the server (or another client). The other function calling 
                        mechanisms (ZRoutedRpc and ZNetView) are both funnelled through Rpc, and are similar 
                        in functionality (remote function calling), but they allow for communication between
                        clients, where the server acts primarily as a middle-man, responsible for transporting
                        messages.

                        Locations are points of interest in Valheim,
                        and generally include the 
                        spawning platform,
                        scattered runestones,
                        camps,
                        dungeons,
                        and boss areas.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                All network transmitted data follows a format depending on
                the datatype being transmitted, however all types refer back 
                to primitive data is serialized/deserialized.
            </li>
            <li>
                All primitives (int, char, double...) follow a format 
                of writing the in-memory representation of the value 
                to the packet. Little endian seems to be the format,
                which is what most machines use. If Valhalla were 
                used on a big-endian machine, it would not work.

                Valhalla has somewhat consistent ZoneLocation generation,
                however things quickly fall apart due of precision.
                
                The Valheim devs have recently addressed this issue 
                in one of the latest patches to the game (doubles instead of floats). 
                
                This is somewhat pointless because
                the new calculations are simply casts to double in-between
                operations:

                <img src="images/prec1.PNG" alt="doubles in-between float calculations">

                <figcaption>
                    <p>
                        DUtils.PerlinNoise utilizes doubles, however it uses
                        UnityEngine.Mathf.PerlinNoise behind the scenes (accepts floats), then it's casted back to float... 
                        This happens numerous times throughout the code.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Valhalla makes use of a reverse engineered implementation of Unity PerlinNoise,
                        And if needed, precision can be increased by just using doubles.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Why bother with these precision changes? 
                        I'm assuming platform differences of C# and WorldGenerator
                        anomalies caused by floats.
                    </p>

            </li>
            <li>
                As the game gets more updates, it will likely drop support for old world versions,
                in order to avoid the codebase from being polluted with legacy code.
                I've debated several times whether to drop old world support or just keep it.

            <li>
                There's an issue with rotations, I'm not sure yet why. Valheim seems to 
                yield the same rotation results. I've only tested the values generated 
                during world loading from file, not what objects might do to rotations 
                once fully loaded. More testing is needed...
